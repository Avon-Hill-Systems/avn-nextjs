              We model each Harvard student as a node in a connected graph, attaching surveyed spending data, location within Cambridge, hometown demographics, income, and other relevant factors that influence consumer behavior. This creates a comprehensive digital representation of each student&apos;s spending patterns.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              When you input a business decision, our proprietary algorithms process this context and map the complete probability structure. They show all possible paths your decision can lead toâ€”not just the most likely outcome, but every scenario with its exact probability. Since our models are built on real spending patterns, you see the causal relationships behind every prediction.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We combine foundational AI models with our proprietary probability models to run thousands of simulations. Each simulation shows how individual student nodes react to your business decision, considering price sensitivity, preferences, seasonal trends, and how the new product fits with existing spending patterns. The results are accurate because every simulation is grounded in real consumer behavior data.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We transform this complex simulation data into clear, actionable insights. You get specific predictions about what will happen, backed by comprehensive data that shows exactly why those outcomes are expected. This gives you the confidence to make informed business decisions.
