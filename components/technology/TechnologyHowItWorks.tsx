              We turn each Harvard student into a node with their real spending data. What they buy, when, how much. No guesswork. We add another layer of context to each node by collecting their location within Cambridge, hometown, demographics, income, and other relevant factors that influence spending behavior.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              When you input a business decision, our static Markov chains process this context and map the complete probability structure. 
              They shows all possible paths your decision can lead toâ€”not just the most likely outcome, but every scenario with its exact probability. 
              Since the chains are modelled on spending patterns, so you see the causal relationships behind every prediction.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We run thousands of simulations using the static Markov chains to see how each student node reacts to your business decision. 
              The system considers price sensitivity, preferences, seasonal trends, and how the new product fits with existing spending patterns. 
              The results are accurate because every simulation is grounded in real consumer behavior data.
